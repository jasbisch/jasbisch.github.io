I am a [doctoral researcher](https://www.ukw.de/en/research-psychiatry/research-at-the-department-of-psychiatry/core-areas-of-research/translational-social-neuroscience/jasper-bischofberger-cv/){:target="_blank"} in the [Translational Social Neuroscience Lab](https://www.ukw.de/en/research-psychiatry/research-at-the-department-of-psychiatry/core-areas-of-research/translational-social-neuroscience/){:target="_blank"} at the Center of Mental Health at the University Hospital WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.

In my [PhD project](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/grk2660/projects/project-area-c/){:target="_blank"}, I am studying how social interactions modulate approach and avoidance learning. I am combining modified versions of reinforcement learning models with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive approach and avoidance behavior. I am [member of the RTG2660: Approach-Avoidance](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/grk2660/people/phd-students/){:target="_blank"} that is funded by the [German Research Foundation](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/433490190){:target="_blank"}.

Apart from research, I am passionate about sustainability, food, and various other ways to increase physical and mental wellbeing.
